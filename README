libmail is a wrapper around libetpan to make it easier to use libetpan
functionality from other languages via a FFI.

Build & Installation
====================

To build and install, run the good old configure, make, make install.
If you checked out the repository (instead of downloading a ready-made source
package), you need to run `autogen.sh' first.

$ ./autogen.sh # optional for source packages
$ ./configure --help # find out which options you need to specify
$ ./configure <your options here>
$ make
$ make install # might need sudo, depending on the installation prefix

libetpan
--------

This repository / source package includes a version of libetpan required to
build libmail at lib/libetpan. In particular it requires the fork with Exchange
support (https://github.com/lysannkessler/libetpan).

If you see the following during configure of libmail:
"checking for libetpan_get_version_major in -letpan... no" bei configure
you did not install libetpan globally or forgot to specify the installation
prefix with --with-libetpan.

If you see something similar to:
src/mail_types.h:41:5: error: unknown type name 'oxws'
chances are that your version of libetpan is not the fork mentioned above.

Separate build directory
------------------------

It is recommended to build in another directory, i.e. all the binaries are not
located in the source directory, but somewhere else. In order to do this, run
configure, make and make install from your target build directory, for example:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure <your options here>
$ make
$ make install
This way you can easily build different configurations next to each other, and
get rid of your build by deleting the build directory.
